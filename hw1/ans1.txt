sh is located in: /usr/bin/sh
using shell command: which mv sh
				  
3. What executable programs have names that are exactly two characters long and end in r, and what do they do? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

pr-converts text files for printing
tr- translates or deletes characters
using shell command: man find
find /usr/local/cs/bin -executable -name "?r"

4. When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, which file actually is executed? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

/usr/bin/emacs-24.3 is being executed
using shell commands: ls -l /usr/bin/emacs
					  ls -l /etc/alternatives/emacs

5. What is the version number of the /usr/bin/gcc program? of the plain gcc program? Why are they different programs?

plain gcc version number is: 8.3.0 
The plain gcc is located in /usr/local/cs/bin which is the first found gcc in the PATH (since we had to prepend it in the beginning) Thus, this is different from the gcc found in /usr/bin
using shell commands: /usr/bin/gcc --version	
                      gcc--version

6. The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic mode u+sx,o-w mean, in terms of permissions?

o-w causes the selected file mode bits of other users not in the file group for writing to be removed (takes away permission)
using shell command: man chmod

7. Use the find command to find all directories modified in the last four weeks that are located under (or are the same as) the directory /usr/local/cs. List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

this question.

librom1394.so.0.3.0 
using shell commands: ls -lat /usr/lib64
					  man stat
					  stat /usr/lib64/librom1394.so.0.3.0 (checking that its a regular file)

10. Where does the locale command get its data from? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

locale command displays the current locale settings for each locale category, based on the settings of the environment variables that control the locale

12. Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-M-r through C-M-v do? Can you list their actions concisely? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.
The emacs keystoke:
C-M-r does an incremental reverse search for regular expressions
C-M-s does an incremental search forward for regular expressions
C-M-t transposes symbolic expressions around a point
C-M-u move backwards out of one level of parentheses
C-M-v scroll next window upward ARG amount of lines, or near full screen if no ARG

Used Emacs command: C-h b C-x o C-s C - M - r C-s 
					then C-h f for isearch-backward-regexp, isearch-forward-regex, transpose-sexps, backward-up-list, scroll-other-window 

13. In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

C-g runs the command keyboard-quit. During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly. At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps
Used Emacs command: C-h k C-g

14. What does the Emacs yank function do, and how can you easily invoke it using keystrokes? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

The Emacs yank function "pulls out" the characters in the "kill ring" that are stored there by the last Emacs kill command.

With the shell command it shows total 324560
Emacs commmand: C-x d / u s r / b i n
Shell command: ls -l /usr/bin
They also show the symbolic links/executable files/etc in different colors
