1. The result is still secure because the bytes are encoded 
2. This only verifies that the key was the one that signed the file
   but does not guarantee who actuall signed the file. To fix this problem
   I would have to have some way that verifies that this key I created
   is associated with my identity. After the person in question verifies 
   that that is my key, they would be able to know that I signed the file.
