We first set up our BeagleBones following the steps on Piazza and designated
one to be the server and the other to be the client. (Server: Grant, Client: Marie)

Server Steps:
$ssh-keygen to generate a public and private key.
Created an acccount for the client on the server
$sudo useradd -d /home/marie -m marie 
-d (new user created using /home/marie as the user's login directory)
-m (create user's home directory if it doesn't already exist)
$sudo passwd marie
Passphrase? password
Then he created a .ssh directory for me
$cd /home/marie
$sudo mkdir .ssh
and changed the ownership 
$sudo chown -R marie .ssh
-R operate on files recursively
$sudo chmod 700 .ssh 
700- owner can read write and execute the file
Then used ifconfig to find ip address of 10.95.87.79

Client Steps:
I ssh-ed into my partner's Beaglebone
$ssh marie@10.95.87.79
and was prompted for the password : password
I then tried it with x-forwarding enabled
$ssh -X marie@10.95.87.79
password
$xterm
and a popup window appeared.

In order to make logins more convenient by not having to type passwords
I generated a public/private key pair
$ssh-keygen
Then I copied my public key to the server for key-based authentication
$ssh-copy-id -i marie@10.95.87.79
-i (use only the key(s) contained in identity file)
ssh-agent (which is a program used to hold private keys used for public key
authentication)
$eval `ssh-agent -s` to start ssh-agent
$ssh-add to add my private key to ssh-agent
I then entered the passphrase

I then logged in without a password
$ssh marie@10.95.87.79

I then tried it with x forwarding
$ssh -X marie@10.95.87.79
$xterm
and the window pops up and required.
